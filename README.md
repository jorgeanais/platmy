Planetary Models
----------------

This utility helps to  produces a grid of models of planetary transmission spectra using the software petitRADTRANS (https://petitradtrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Models are computed in parallel.

This is part of my research assistance work at Universidad de Antofagasta, under the supervision of Dr. Jeremy Tregloan-Reed.

This repo use third party software that is not included here.

The folder `notebooks` contains some tutorials on how to use this code.
